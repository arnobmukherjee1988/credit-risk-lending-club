MONTE CARLO STRESS TESTING - PORTFOLIO RISK ANALYSIS
====================================================

Simulation Framework:
  Portfolio size: 168,699 loans
  Number of simulations: 10,000
  Model: Logistic regression (Gini 0.394)
  Base expected default rate: 22.67%

Stress Scenarios Tested:

1. BASE CASE (No Stress)
   Expected default rate: 22.67%
   Standard deviation: 0.0010
   VaR 95%: 22.83%
   VaR 99%: 22.89%
   CVaR 95%: 22.87%
   CVaR 99%: 22.92%

2. RECESSION SCENARIO (All PDs x 1.5)
   Expected default rate: 34.00%
   Standard deviation: 0.0010
   VaR 95%: 34.16%
   VaR 99%: 34.23%
   CVaR 95%: 34.21%
   CVaR 99%: 34.27%

   Impact: +11.3%pp increase in defaults

3. SEGMENT-SPECIFIC STRESS (High-risk 2x stressed)
   Affected borrowers: 42,174 (25.0%)
   Expected default rate: 32.53%
   Standard deviation: 0.0009
   VaR 95%: 32.68%
   VaR 99%: 32.74%
   CVaR 95%: 32.71%
   CVaR 99%: 32.76%

   Impact: +9.9%pp increase in defaults

Key Insights:
1. Recession scenario is most severe: defaults rise from 22.7% to 34.0%
2. High-risk segment concentration risk: top 25% borrowers drive 9.9pp increase
3. Tail risk (CVaR): In worst 5% scenarios, expect 34.2% defaults under recession
4. Portfolio has significant downside risk requiring capital buffers

Business Value:
- Early warning system for capital adequacy
- Scenario planning for different economic conditions  
- Portfolio concentration risk identification
- Risk-adjusted pricing inputs
- Regulatory stress testing compliance

Status: Ready for risk committee review and capital planning integration
