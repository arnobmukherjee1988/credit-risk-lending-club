BAYESIAN LOGISTIC REGRESSION - UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION
==========================================================

Model Configuration:
  Training sample: 50,000 loans (7.5% of full training set)
  MCMC samples: 2,000 per chain (2 chains)
  Convergence: Excellent (all R-hat = 1.0)

Performance (Validation Set):
  AUC: 0.6966
  Gini: 0.3933
  (Comparable to frequentist logistic regression)

Uncertainty Quantification:
  Mean prediction: 22.29%
  Mean std dev: 0.0060
  Mean 95% interval width: 0.0235

Key Insight:
  Higher-risk predictions have higher uncertainty
  - Low-risk decile: 0.0020 std dev
  - High-risk decile: 0.0099 std dev

Business Value:
  Risk managers can identify borderline cases with high uncertainty
  where manual review provides most value

Status: Bayesian model ready for uncertainty-aware decision making
